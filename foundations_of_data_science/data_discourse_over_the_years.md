# Data Discourse Over the Years

### What is Data Science vs. Data Analytics?

Data Science: A field dedicated to making data more useful. Data scientists use raw data to develop new models, make predictions, and confront the unknown, often incorporating computer science, predictive analytics, statistics, and machine learning.
Data Analytics: A subfield of data science focused on creating methods to capture, process, and organize data to uncover actionable insights for solving current problems. Data analysts rely on statistics and data modeling to answer questions and recommend immediate improvements.

| Data science | Data analytics | 
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Produces broad insights that concentrate on which questions should be asked about data | Emphasizes discovering answers to questions being asked |
| Confronts what is unknown by using advanced techniques to make predictions about the future | Determines actionable insights that can be applied immediately based on existing queries |

### The Connections Between Data Science and Data Analytics

- Both fields aim to discover insights to help organizations improve and grow.
- They share common tools, software packages, and programming languages, often leading to collaborative environments where data scientists and analysts work together.
