  - Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
  - Clean, scrub, and format data into usable forms.
- Summary: Gather, organize, and analyze data to prepare it for modeling.

---

#### **Construct**
- Purpose: Build models to uncover **hidden relationships** within the data.
- Tasks:
  - Select modeling approach.
  - Build models and machine learning algorithms.
  - Revise and interpret models.
- Summary: Develop tools that enable informed decision-making through insights.

---

#### **Execute**
- Purpose: Share findings, receive **feedback**, and make revisions.
