# RACI Matrix Activity

## What is RACI?
RACI is a framework for organizing roles and responsibilities in projects, ensuring clarity and efficiency. It categorizes involvement into four levels:

- **Responsible (R)**:  
  Team members directly perform the work or make decisions related to completing a task. Multiple roles can share this responsibility.

- **Accountable (A)**:  
  The person who approves the work done by those responsible. Typically, a single individual, like a manager or project lead.

- **Consulted (C)**:  
  Experts or stakeholders who provide input and feedback. Communication between responsible and consulted parties is two-way.

- **Informed (I)**:  
  Individuals or leaders who are kept updated on progress and decisions. They do not perform tasks but need to stay aware of outcomes.

The RACI matrix simplifies understanding roles and ensures all team members and stakeholders know their level of involvement in each task. This clarity helps streamline communication and project execution.

### Step 1: Review Four Common Data Professional Roles
1. **Data Scientist**:  
   Works closely with analytics to provide meaningful insights that help improve current business operations.

2. **Data Engineer**:  
   Responsible for infrastructure, developing, and managing databases. Often collaborates with data scientists to build pipelines for managing raw data.

3. **Analytics Team Manager**:  
   Leads a company’s analytics department, supervises projects, and implements strategies to convert raw data into business insights.

4. **Business Intelligence (BI) Engineer**:  
   Uses knowledge of business trends and databases to organize information and make it accessible. Also known as a business intelligence analyst.

# Explanation of RACI Matrices

Access to data: 
- Based on their general roles within an organization, the business intelligence engineer, analytics team manager, and data engineer have all been identified as **responsible** for providing access to the data.
- The data scientist, who is more responsible for working with the analytics team to draw insights from the data, is just **consulted**. 

Create models to analyze data: 
- The data scientist, who is primarily concerned with drawing insights from the data, is **responsible** for this task. 
- The business intelligence engineer and analytics team manager are **consulted**. 
- The data engineer, who is concerned with infrastructure, is kept **informed**. 

Drive insights and recommendations based on data: 
- Similarly to the previous task, the data scientist is the primary team member **responsible** for this task. 

Ensure data compliance: 
- Data compliance is part of developing and managing databases, which is the **responsibility** of the data engineer. 
- Other team members are **consulted** or **informed**, but the data engineer is tasked with the actual responsibility of ensuring compliance.

Chief data officer: 
- Although all of the tasks in this project are the direct responsibility of other team members, the company’s chief data officer is **accountable** for them—meaning this role has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring this task is completed.
